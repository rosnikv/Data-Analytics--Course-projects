German Credit Scoring using R

A credit scoring system should be able to classify customers as good credit those who are expected to repay on time and as 
bad credit those who are expected to fail. This study illustrates the use of data mining techniques to construct credit scoring 
models. Also, it illustrates the comparison of credit scoring models to give a superior final model.
