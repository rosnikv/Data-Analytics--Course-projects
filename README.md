German Credit Scoring using R

A credit scoring system should be able to classify customers as good credit those who are expected to repay on time and as 
bad credit those who are expected to fail. This study illustrates the use of data mining techniques to construct credit scoring 
models. Also, it illustrates the comparison of credit scoring models to give a superior final model.

Market Basket Analysis in Groceries Dataset (using R and RapidMiner)

Market Basket Analysis is one of the most common and useful types of data analysis for marketing and retailing. The purpose of market basket analysis is to determine what products customers purchase together. This study illustrates the use of data mining techniques (Apriori Algorithm and Frequency Pattern Growth) to construct association rules. Also, it illustrates the rules in a graph. We consider Association Mining in the groceries dataset. The outcome of this type of technique, in simple terms, is a set of rules that can be understood as ”if this, then that”.

groceries.csv is the data file
aRules.R has the code for apriori algorith as well data preprocessing
Report Folder contains 04-dynamic-doc.pdf Which explains everything about the work
